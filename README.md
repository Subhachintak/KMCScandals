# Kathmandu Model College (KMC) Scandals Archive

This repo is dedicated to collecting and preserving all the stories, reports, and posts shared by students (mostly on Reddit) about the abusive environment at **Kathmandu Model College (KMC)**.

Since many of these posts get deleted over time (probably due to fear or pressure), we’ve backed them up using [archive.ph](https://archive.ph). This will make sure the truth doesn’t disappear.

# **⚠️ DISCLAIMER – READ BEFORE CONTINUING**

The following posts, links, and media are archived solely for backup and reference purposes. Most of the content here comes from anonymous students online (especially Reddit), and should not be treated as verified facts.

These stories might be true, exaggerated, or in some cases, completely false - **we don’t know for sure.** The goal of this archive is to make sure student voices don’t disappear, especially in situations where posts get deleted out of fear or pressure.

🔘 Innocent until proven guilty — Always.  
🔘 Do not harass or target any individuals or institutions mentioned here.  
🔘 You are not the law, Do not take them into your own hands.  

Again: This is not a verdict. It’s a backup of online complaints for awareness, discussion, and possible investigation in the future — nothing more.
